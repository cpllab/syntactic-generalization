# Test suites

The test suites used to evaluate our models are currently released in `.csv`, `.txt`, and `.json` format. For a full description of each test suite, please see Appendix B of [our ACL 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03692).

Files in the [csv](`csv`) folder each describe a single test suite, with the following structure (padding added here for readability):

    item_number,  condition_name,  region_number,  region_name,    content
    1,            near,            1               demonstrative,  This
    1,            near,            2,              rest,           is an example.
    1,            far,             1,              demonstrative,  That
    1,            far,             2,              rest,           is an example.

Files in the [txt](`txt`) folder list the sentences generated by each item, in order of their conditions. (The above example suite would generate two sentences, for example.) Each sentence is simply a concatenation of its corresponding regions.

The [json](`json`) folder contains the original structured representations of each test suite, including essential metadata such as predictions. We will later release a tool for reading and computing with these JSON structures.
